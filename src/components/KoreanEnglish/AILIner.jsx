              Mr.Son Reporter = Liner, an Ai-powered search service developed in Korea, has gained greater
              popularity in the United States. Global uers make up 90% of Liner's uer base, and 60% of its, 
              paid subscribers are from the U.S.
            </p>
            <p>
              Liner's primary users are college students and graduate researchers, as the service specializes
              in collecting and analyzing data. This functionality is also essential for journalists which is 
              why I decided to try Liner Copilot by installing it on my laptop.
            </p>
            <p>
              Liner utilizes generative AI technology, similar to ChatGPT to provide ansers to user questions.
              While ChatGPT relies on extensive pre-trained data, Liner collects the latest information from 
              the web in real-time to generate answers. It also displays the source for each sentence in its 
              response.

              <h3> Show me the operating profit of News1 for 2023</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
              The specific information regarding News1's operating profit for 2023 is not currently available. 
              For further details, it is recommended to check the company's disclosure materials or recent news 
              reports for their financial performance.

              Recent generative AI chatbots tend to answer ambiguous questions with "I don't know" to 
              reduce hallucinations, where they pretend to know something they don't. Liner, however, 
              takes a different approach. It admits when it doesn't know the answer but still strives to 
              provide as much verified information from the web as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, when asked about "News1's operating profit for 2023", Liner responds, "Based on web documents,
              no specific information related to the operating profit can be found." Since there are no existing documents 
              regarding News1's 2023 operating profit, Liner provides an answer that aligns with the reality of the situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, Liner does not stop there. Instead, it focues on keywords like "media company" and "operating profit",
              providing insights into revenue and profit trends of other media outlets, influencing financial performance, and
              perspectives from the media industry. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The best part of using it for writing articles is that it finds academic papers related to the desired topic.
              Additionally, it can summarize a lengthy PDF document of hundreds of pages into a single A4 page.
              Even papers written in English or Japanese can be summarized in Korean.

              It also has an image analysis feature. It can translate images with English text into Korean and 
              interpret complex tables and graphs into easily understandable text. However, when analyzing 
              a presidential approval rating graph, it sometimes confused negative and positive figures.

            <p>
              Above all, Liner is especially useful on YouTube. When there's no time to watch a full 20 minute 
              video, requesting a summary from Liner provides a breakdown of key topics by timestamp within a minute. 
              Additionally, highlighting specific moments allows for easy access later, as they are saved in 'My Liner' 
              for future reference.
