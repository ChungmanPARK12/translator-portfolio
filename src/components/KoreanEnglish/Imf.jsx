              It is expected that South Korea's economy will not be out of the early 2% growth rate 
              until five years later. The IMF(International Monetary Fund) predicted that in the long 
              term, it seems the Korean government debt will be higher that GDP as twice 50 years later. 
              It is a warning that 'Peak Korea(The economy is peaking and going down)' will be real, 
              if the Korean government can't suggest a solution for a low birth rate and aging population. 
            </p>
            <p>
              According to an annual consultation report for the IMF of Korea on this 19th, the growth rate 
              of the economy of Korea will increase from 1.4% this year to 2.2% next year and then it will 
              stay at 2.1 ~ 2.3%. A concrete outlook is 2.3% in 2026, 2.2% in 2027 and 2.1% in 2008. 
              Although this figure is higher than this year, it still stays at the 2% range which means 
              the growth rate has stopped.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, the outlook for potential growth means the basic foundations of the national economy are 
              similar too. The IMF expected Korea's potential growth rate to stay at 2.1% and 2.2% for each 
              this year and next year including 2025 to 2028 as well. The potential growth rate is a growth 
              rate that can be achieved without causing inflation by mobilizing all factors of production 
              such as labor and capital. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In the same annual consultation report last year, the IMF expected Korea's potential growth rate 
              to be 2.3% to 2.4% from 2025 to 2027 but lowered it in a year, even this figure is positive 
              compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) because the OECD 
              estimated that Korea's potential growth rate will decrease to 1.7%.

              <h3>IMF Warns Peak Korea "Growth May Hover in Low 2% Range for Next Five Years"</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, the financial outlook is not good eighter. 
              <p>A warning light was turned on that 
              a large scale financial burden could come due to the depletion of the national pension. </p>
              The IMF expected that the government debt would double as GDP in 2075 unless there is 
              pension reform in the future. This is the result of assuming that if the government could 
              fill the deficit of the national pension. As a result of the national pension financial 
              estimation, the national pension will turn into a deficit in 2041, and the fund will be 
              exhausted in 2055. 
            </p>
            <p>
              So, the IMF suggested a plan to integrate the national pension with other occupational 
              pensions, such as the civil service pension. It is pointed out that operating the pension 
              system separately causes equity problems and is administratively inefficient. Plus, 
              as the government dept increases rapidly compared with GDP, considering such as the 
              expansion of the retirement age so increases the pension contribution rate.

                 The growth rate is aleady in a pefiod of depression. The prospect of "Peak Korea" 
                 seems to be real as concerns that financial soundness is also not guaranteed in the mid 
                 to long term. Even when the Asian Financial Crisis in 1990, Korea's annual growth rate  
                 was at 7.32% and it started decreasing since 2000 to 4% to 3% in 2010. From 2019, 
                 the growth rate never exceeded 3% except the growth rate of 4.2% in 2021 due to the base 
                 effect of the previous year which was reversely grown due to COVID-19. It seems hard to 
                 expect the outlook figure to be 3% this year. The Japanese business magazine "Money 1" 
                 recently mentioned "Peak Korea" in a provocative article titled "Korea is over."

                Low birth rates and aging populations are cited as the background of Peak Korea. 
                Korea will hvae 80 elderly support expenses higher than Japan in 2050. The elderly support 
                and expense has to support 80 elderly out of 100 in the working-age population. 
                The working-age population which is the economic entity will decrease and the economy will 
                lost vitality as the population they have to support increase.

              The experts say that it's going to be hard to get out of the dark prospect of 'Peak Korea' 
              without pension reform. 'Mr. Lee', a professor in the Department of Economist at Chung-Ang 
              University sait that Koreat will be a super-aging society in 2025, not noly reducing productivity 
              with less labor but also, slowing down domestic demand due to less consumption. 
              'Harrold Finger' the director of the IMF Mission said that it is important for structural reform 
              to promote growth in the long term and solve the issue for an aging population and pointed out 
              that it needs pension reform for the flexible labor market and the possiblity of keeping financial 
              growth in the long term. 
            </p>
            <p>
              'Mr.Seok' a professor, in the Department of Economists at Ewha Women's Univesity, said that 
              statistics also show that the growth rate continues to fall, and the potential growth rate is 
              also break by population problems so it needs to be increased investment in higher education 
              to increase labor productivity per capita, companies to actively hire employees and labor flexibility 
              is essential to secure productivity
