            <p>
              Microsoft experienced a huge scale of service outages in July 2024. So the major IT services such as Azure, Microsoft 365 teams, etc, 
              have been stopped for several hours, and millions of users and businesses have experienced inconvenience. According to the initial investigation, 
              the cause of the outage was identified as a "configuration error in the data center network", more specifically, the computer system crash occurred 
              due to the deployment of a "faulty security software update from a cybersecurity company", Cloud Strike.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This disturbance caused huge damage to users and corporations, and the primary issues included restricted data accessibility, decreased work productivity, 
              and disruption of business continuity. In particular, direct costs resulting from the service outage are expected to be significant due to its impact on businesses.

              <h3>The importance of data protection</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
              Data is one of the important properties in the modern business environment. Data loss or service disruptions can severely impact a corporation’s reputation, profitability, 
              and operational efficiency. In addition, "thorough data protection is essential" to meet various data regulations or data security requirements. 
            </p>
            <p>
              There were similar service disturbances in the past and it would still occur in the future. The most important effective approach to strengthening cybersecurity resilience is to assume that 
              incidents like this outage will always occur. "Companies with strong data protection measures in place can recover quickly", 
              while those without may suffer significant damage. So these IT outage incidents further highlight the importance of data protection.
