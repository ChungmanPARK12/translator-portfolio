              The new iPhone15 series shows a similar sales pattern to the iPhone14. 
        
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the iPhone 15 was officially released in Korea last month, there has been a shortage of iPhone 15 Pro models.

              The telecommunication industry official mentioned it is true that the sales volume of iPhone 15 has increased 
              slightly compared with previous versions, but it still has a similar level of sales to the iPhone 14 as well as showing 
              the high demand focusing on the new version of the series. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Customers tend to prefer the higher version of the model, which includes the iPhone15 Pro or iPhone15 Pro Max, to the lower model, 
              such as iPhone15, iPhone15 Plus, etc. The agency staff of LG Uplus mentioned that it is easy to purchase the iPhone 15 model for both 128gigabite (GB), 
              and 256gigabite (GB) with any color as well as the iPhone 15 Plus model but, the iPhone 15 Pro is already sold out in the standard natural titanium color.

              Also, another mobile store staff of SKY said that it seems like there is a higher demand in the sales of the iPhone 15 Pro, and similarly, it would be easy to purchase the iPhone 15 model.

              According to the result of the pre-booking from KT’s customers for iPhone, iPhone 15 Pro accounts for over 50% of the total customers who are under booking, and iPhone Pro Max accounts for 20%. 
              The iPhone 15 Pro with natural titanium color was the most popular model among customers.

              Just as the iPhone 15 Pro is becoming popular nowadays, the iPhone 14 series has also been in high demand among certain iPhone models before. Another telecommunication industry official said that also, 
              the iPhone 14 series had a shortage of products because it was a popular model like the Pro model but, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models kept adequate products.

              In the case of the iPhone 14 series last year, customers had to wait for several weeks to activate their mobile, and customers had to wait for more than a month to receive their iPhone 14 delivered by the Apple Korea website.

              Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 series has been released in Korea since the 13th. It is a delayed date of about 3 weeks compared with the first and second launching countries. It was released on the 22nd in the first launching countries 
              such as the USA, Japan, and other 40countries. The iPhone 15 series model was in the spotlight for featuring a USB-C Type for the first time.
