              The owner of Neuralink, a neuroscience company, Elon Musk the best CEO began the clinical test of implantation the computer chip into the human brain on 29th Jan.

              Musk uploaded to his SNS that the first patient had implanted the chip from Neuralink yesterday and the patient is recovering well.
            </p>
            <p>
              He mentioned the first product(implant chip) is called “Telepathy”. It enables to control all devices such as phones, computers, or any device with only thinking.

              Plus, the first user would be the person who is not able to move their arms or legs and he mentioned that just imagine that if Stephen Hawking could type faster than a typist or auctioneer, that’s our goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Nreuralink has been developing the technology that the brain-computer interface(BCI) implantation into the human brain to control any devices with only thinking for the person who lost the use of their physical.
            </p>
            <p>
              They explained that this study is the implantation of the BCI device by the robot to control the movement of the brain.

            <p>
              So the first goal of this study is to control the cursor and keyboard in a computer through BCI.
            </p>
            <p>
              Musk added the comment that even a person who was born blind could have their vision.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Stephen Hawking that Musk mentioned is the best physicist in the world who got amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(muscle paralysis) when he was 21age, so he couldn’t move his body and he had to use a wheelchair.

                The FDA offered permission last May for Neural’s chip implantation and clinical tests that help a lot of patients to overcome paralysis and nerve disorders. 
                Neuralink got approved for recruiting for clinical tests last September.

              The neural’s first goal was to implant the microchip under 2mm into the brain.
            </p>
            <p>
              This figure is deeper than developed from Neuroscience, which is another BCI company. 
              Bloomberg evaluated Neuralink and said that they still have a long way to go.
            </p>
            <p>
              Neiralink has started to run their kind of latest business for brain implants than other competitors such as Blacklock neurotech of Sinkron, 
              so it is expected to get attention for competition running business between companies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Neuralink has been embroiled in controversy for the safety of the first test.
            </p>
            <p>
              They have been trying the test on animals since 2016, there were some side effects like paralysis, seizures, and some problems with the brain for the material that has been implanted in the monkey. 
              The four members of representatives in the United States claimed that the monkeys on the test had experienced that side effect last November, and at least 12 young and healthy monkeys were sacrificed.   
            </p>
            <p>
              So the representatives requested to investigate if Musk manipulated the investors or any corrupted contracts about the testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Routers announced from the interview with employees in Neuralink that it is about 1500 animals sacrificed by Neuralink’s testing after 2018.

              The commercial value of Neuralink is estimated to be $500 million since the last June.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              Musk uploaded and explained to his SNS that there were no killed monkeys by the test last September. Plus, he mentioned that he used the old Monkeys that were about to die soon instead of young Monkeys.
