              (SEOUL, Yonhap News) By Noh Jae-hyun = The analysis says that “The Line situation” caused by Japanese abnormal 
              administrative guidance is an ambition of Japan inferior for IT in the world about the Line platform.  
            </p>

             <p>
              Wi Jeong-hyeon, head of the preparatory committee of the Citizens' Coalition for Fairness and Justtice in IT 
              (Dean of the Da Vinci College of General Education at Chung-Ang University), said this during an "Emergency Forum on the LINE Incident"
              held at the National Assembly on the 24th, co-hosted by Democratic Party lawmaker Jeon Yong-gi, the Content Future Convergence Forum, 
              and the Content Management Research Institute. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The chairman points out in the presentation of the debate that the cause of this situation because 
              Japan is an undeveloped country for IT technology and they tried to overtake Samsung and LG 30 years ago. 
            </p>
          
            <p>
              Plus, it judged that Japan is the only country in the world that uses floppy disks until February this year, 
              which means Japan’s IT business relies on overseas companies and exports overseas.  
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, it is not surprising to say that it is the sinking of a Japanese IT company, and Japan has a desire to rob the line platform, 
              “he said.” Japan has prepared for the recent situation for a long time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The chairman pointed out that it was the problem in the first place when Japan Softbank decided to integrate Zholdings, 
              the operating company of Line and Yahoo and it was not a normal combination method for holding a 50-50 stake in AHoldings, 
              the majority shareholder of Line and Yahoo.
            </p>
            <p>
              He is concerned that synergy between the two companies has disappeared due to Softbank’s unilateral dominance ,
              and Line and Yahoo’s subsidiaries, IPX and LineNext, could all be handed over to Softbank. .
            </p>
            <p>
              He said that Japan is forming a common front beyond the party of progress and conservatism in the Line and Yahoo incident, 
              and that the South Korean government should demand that the sale of the stake be withdrawn from the administrative guidance. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, he argued that The National Assembly should adopt a bipartisan resolution strongly protesting the Japanese government’s 
              irrational and illegal administrative guidance that ignores the Korea-Japan investment agreement and international law and 
              investigations and discussions on related issues are necessary during the parliamentary audit this fall.

              In addition, the assemblyman, Mr.Jeon’ said that it is not surprising that Japan is planning a second invasion, 
              but it is deeply frustrating that the government does not actively deal with it.

              One of the debaters, Mr Lee, Korean University of Foreign Studies said that The Lind and Yahoo incident is a political issue, 
              it has become a matter that has a significant impact on the national interests of the two countries, 
              such as cooperation between Korea and Japan and economic security, beyond Naver and Softbank. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, as a diplomatic issue, the attitude toward resolution is also important and it should be resolved through strengthening of Korea-Japan cooperation businesses. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The General Secretary of Japan conducted two extraordinary administrative guidance in March and April this year due to a cyber attack that 
              infected Naver Cloud’s business consignment PC with malicious code and leaked personal information from Line and Yahoo, 
              which shared some internal systems in November last year.
            </p>
            <p>
              In particular, suspicions are raised as to whether it is trying to take away Line from Naver, which has become a ‘popular messenger’ in Japan 
               that is a joint majority shareholder with Line, and Yahoo while Japan demanding a review of its capital relationship.
